# renogy-bt-esphome
ESPHome implementation to pull data from BT-enabled Renogy devices

## Setup
renogy_batteries.yaml is configured to connect to a single Renogy BT device (currently tested on a BT-2 connected to three batteries in a daisy-chained configuration.) There are todos in the yaml that indicate places where updates should be made, or at least pertinent information for the user is available.

renogy_utilities.h contains methods that do the heavy-lifting regarding prepping requests to be sent to the BT device and parsing the response.
